# QR code component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, a basic understanding of HTML and CSS is required.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Can be used any tools to complete the challenge. 

## The Task

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. There are both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format.  

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building project

Suggested Steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying the project

Recommended hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)


This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.
